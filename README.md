## Run the script

First, you need to install the dependencies :

```bash
  npm install
```

Then, edit the config.json with your user token and the content to search for (you can learn how get it [here](https://gist.github.com/MarvNC/e601f3603df22f36ebd3102c501116c6)) :

```json
  {
    TOKEN="YOUR_USER_TOKEN",
    MESSAGE_CONTENT="MESSAGE_CONTENT_TO_SEARCH"
  }
```
Finally, you can just run `start.bat` and wait.
